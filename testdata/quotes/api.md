# Title with "quotes"

As we want to verify that this markdown is formatted equally in both the general
API description, in a tag description and in an endpoint description, the tag
defined in main.go is called api, and the markdown file name is specified
manually in the description comment in api/api.go.

```json
{
	"with": "escaped \"quotes\"",
	"indentedWith": "tabs",
	"foo": "bar",
	"baz": null
}
```
